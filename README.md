## Repository for the study of global and local explainability using kernel methods 

Local_Matrix.py: contains the class that handles the conversion from a global kernel to a local one

Test_independece_PHI.py: script to test whether the matrix PHI has independent columns (this is a requiremet for the local matrix to work)

Test_distance_local_matrix.py: script to test the effects of various parameters on the transformation from global kernels to local ones using importance sampling.\

Results.ipynb: Notebook to visualize the results of Test_distance_local_matrix.py.\
